Additional comment on the Hough Transform

We can find information about Hough Transform in the file cicle_detector.cpp

First we determine some constant data:

//constants
const double HOUGH_ACCUM_RESOLUTION = 2;
const double HOUGH_ACCUM_TH = 70;

Then, the Hough Transform allows to detect circles in an image.

  //**************** Find circles in the image ****************************

        //Apply the Hough Transform to find the circles
        cv::HoughCircles( gray_image, circles, CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT, HOUGH_ACCUM_RESOLUTION, MIN_CIRCLE_DIST, CANNY_EDGE_TH, HOUGH_ACCUM_TH, MIN_RADIUS, MAX_RADIUS );
